## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hello! 👋  
I’m a **full-stack JavaScript developer** 💻 passionate about building modern, high-performance web and back-end systems 🚀.

I specialize in **React** ⚛️, using **hooks** 🪝, **Context API** 🧠, and component architecture 🧱 to create dynamic, responsive SPAs 📱. To boost performance and SEO, I use **Next.js** ⚡, and for styling — **styled-components** 🎨 or **Tailwind CSS** 🌬️.

On the server side 🖥️, I develop **REST** 🔗 and **GraphQL** 🧬 APIs using Node.js frameworks 🌲, structure code into modular services 🧩, and design microservices with message queue communication 📬. I integrate authentication via **JWT** 🔐 and **OAuth2** 🛡️, automate testing 🧪 and deployment 🚚 with CI/CD ⚙️.

For data storage 🗃️, I design schemas in **MongoDB** 🍃 with **Mongoose** 🐍, optimize queries through indexing 📇 and aggregation 📊, and use **MongoDB Atlas** ☁️ for scalable managed databases.

I am committed to performance ⚡, security 🛡️, and maintainability 🧼, work well in teams 🤝, mentor colleagues 👨‍🏫, and contribute to open-source 🌍.

**Let’s connect 🤝 to tackle challenging projects 🧠 and explore innovative solutions 💡!**

🚀 Open to collaboration, open-source, and interesting challenges. Feel free to reach out for technical discussions or proposals!
